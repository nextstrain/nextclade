## What is Nextclade?

Nextclade is a tool that identifies differences between your sequences and a reference sequence used by Nextstrain,
uses these differences to assign your sequences to clades, and reports potential sequence quality issues in your data.
You can use the tool to analyze sequences before you upload them to a database, or if you want to assign Nextstrain clades to a set of sequences.

To analyze your data, drag a fasta file onto the upload box or paste sequences into the text box.
These sequences will then be analyzed in your browser -- data never leave your computer.
Since your computer is doing the work rather than a server, it is advisable to analyze at most a few hundred sequences at a time.
Nextclade currently only supports SARS-CoV-2, but we will hopefully extend the tool to other pathogens on Nextstrain.

The source code for the application and algorithms is opensource and is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/nextstrain/nextclade). User manual is available at [docs.nextstrain.org/projects/nextclade](https://docs.nextstrain.org/projects/nextclade).


### What are the clades?

Nextclade was originally developed during COVID-19 pandemic, historically primarily focused on SARS-CoV-2, and at the time of writing, this is still the main use-case. This section describes clades with application to SARS-CoV-2, but Nextclade can analyse other pathogens too.

Since its emergence in late 2019, SARS-CoV-2 has diversified into several different co-circulating variants. To
facilitate discussion of these variants, we have grouped them into __clades__ which are defined by specific
signature mutations.

We currently define 18 major clades (see [this blog post](https://nextstrain.org/blog/2021-01-06-updated-SARS-CoV-2-clade-naming)
for details):

- 19A and 19B emerged in Wuhan and have been dominating the early outbreak
- 20A emerged from 19A out of dominated the European outbreak in March and has since spread globally
- 20B and 20C are large genetically distinct subclades 20A emerged in early 2020
- 20D to 20I have emerged over the summer of 2020 and include three "Variants of Concern" (VoC).
- 21A to 21F include the VoC __delta__ and several Variants of Interest (VoI).

Within Nextstrain, we define each clade by its combination of signature mutations.
You can find the exact clade definition in [github.com/nextstrain/ncov/defaults/clades.tsv](https://github.com/nextstrain/ncov/blob/master/defaults/clades.tsv). When available, we will include [WHO labels for VoCs and VoIs](https://www.who.int/en/activities/tracking-SARS-CoV-2-variants/).
