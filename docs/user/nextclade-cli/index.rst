Nextclade CLI
================================================================================

Nextclade CLI is a tool that identifies differences between your sequences and a reference sequence, uses these differences to assign your sequences to clades, and reports potential sequence quality issues in your data. You can use the tool to analyze sequences before you upload them to a database, or if you want to assign Nextstrain clades to a set of sequences.

This section describes:

- how to install Nextclade CLI - using Docker, as a standalone executable, or using conda
- how to run Nextclade CLI with sample data
